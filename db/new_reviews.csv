BMW quality stands out," I moved up from a 4 cylinder diesel BMW 328 to the 535. While I gave up better mileage on the 4 cylinder, I got more room, window display, and a few more options that make driving a pleasure. I have owned other high quality cars, but the interior trim of the BMW with the rich wood and colors seem to stand out more. It may not hug the road like the 328, but neither did my other larger cars. Diesel engines rock, and if the public is scared off by the VW publicity, shame on them. In the long run, the quality of BMW engines and technology will keep the value of these cars up. I have liked this 2016 BMW 535 so much, I have decided to keep it beyond the two year period I usually trade cars. You can't hear the diesel engine, the cut off does not bother me (there is a switch to cut this feature off if it bothers others) and having driven many other gas and diesel engines, I know how to get above the EPA rated mileage. You get savings both ways with diesel prices going down or if fuel prices go up.....you will have more driving range then a gasoline engine. In the worst case, if we ever had a gas shortage, you can bet diesel fuel will be around. In short, my write up is no substitute for you taking a test drive in this auto and see for yourself.   UPDATE: This review was written in late 2015. My opinion has not changed. It was one of the best buys in automobiles I ever made.May 19, 2017: My review of this car remains unchanged. I had Opti Coat put on it after I bought it and I keep it garaged and personally detail the vehicle to 'show room condition'. My wife and I use it primarily for long trips because it is so comfortable and roomy. If you check reviews today of the vehicle, you will see it is rated as one of the best. Because one car company cheated on diesel engines, it scared the public about diesels for awhile. I also have a 2017 BMW M24i, and a 2016 Prius V. But for comfort and style, you can't beat this car. Have had absoluty no trouble with it. Outside of changing the oil, the dealership put on new wiper blades. I plan on keeping this car a long time.", 11/01/15,5,3466
Great Car," The 740i is an incredible car.  Fun todrive plus has plenty of room both front and back.  Loves to cruise at 80ph+.  Quiet and comfortable ride. ve had some problems, radiator andwnshield wipers, but both were taken caeof on factory warranty.  Dealererie has been courteous and pomt", 11/30/02,5,1858
Love my M Sport 535i," Don't know why Edmunds have only manual 6-speed option for 535i, but this car with auto sport shifter is very responsive and quick. It feels heavy when you start driving but you can't feel the speed unless you look at your speedometer. I like the comfy feel of this car. I like the damper control that you can choose the mode. I don't know why ppl criticize the interior, to me, this interior is far better than Audi's cheap plastic feel interiors. Overall space is good as well and at this point, i can't say anything about reliability since I just got the car for 2 days. I will update of course in the future. ", 05/26/12,4,3440
BMW 335D performance," directly after the expiry of manufacturer's warranty, the turbos failed. They fail unexpectedly so, if I am on the road, the car will suddenly lose turbo power, and, despite engine revs rising, nothing speeds the car over 40 mph. The car has spent more time and I have spent more money in repair shops than I spent on a smaller car I have as well, which runs flawlessly. I had believed that, after having spent a small fortune purchasing this car, I would not need extended warranty, but I was wrong! The help I received from Bavarian was no help at all. I was offered a $1000 discount on my next purchase of a Beamer!  I wanted to have some diagnosis, but all the diagnostics have been steadily repaired and the same problem recurs. I wonder if the car was made to run in cooler weather, as it runs hot and may have caused damage to the diagnostics in the computer, which is the more expensive one to replace", 09/16/16,1,6283
Finally a diesel that matches a gas engine," Got this 3 serie wagon in the fall and have driven about 1,800 miles. The car performs flawlessly. It's fun to drive, taunt and the interior execution is fantastic. At the end of the week I can't help but smile when I realise I get a combined 35 mpg on a week of driving. This little machine will outperform 90% of V6 engines out there (although 0-60 is still a bit slow for my taste).", 01/02/14,4,4455
Plenty of power and plenty of fun.," I recently bought a loaded, low-mileage, certified pre-owned 2014 X3 with the 4 cylinder turbo engine.   I was concerned that the 4 cylinder engine would be short on performance.  But, that is not the case at all.   The car gets up and goes, especially when it's in Sport mode.  You don't need the bigger 6 cylinder engine to have fun in this vehicle.   I have taken my X3 up into the mountains along with 2 passengers and luggage.  It went up the mountain without breaking a sweat.  The turbo powered engine along with the 8-speed transmission works flawlessly and always keeps the X3 it's toes.   Plus, the handling is amazing.   I have owned some sporty coupes over the years, and this X3 feels just as sporty as any on them.   I love it!", 04/14/16,5,2462
Great Car nut's machine, If you enjoy long road trips and driving on twisty mountain roads this is the car for you !  I now have 70000 miles on the car and I love this car more than the day I bought it.  I have had one ignition coil failure since I bought the car and no other problems what so ever.  Car is just as tight and precise handling as the day I bought it.  I plan on driving to 100000 miles and will most likely buy another BMW.  It absolutely is the ultimate driving machine!  By the way I am not a BMW employee!!, 11/08/16,5,6362
Very disappointed," In 10 months had to go to the dealer about 10 times. The engine on light was malfunctioning, then the tires wore out badly, tires cost about $2000, after a year, thats a joke. I had sebring convertible,put same mileage on it, had no problems. BMW is unreliable to me. It is otherwise nice looking car, fun to drive.", 11/14/10,5,6337
"Fun car, fear costly maintenance down the road"," The 335i was a super fun car to drive.   Although the 2011 got the slightly less tunable/powerful N55, it still had lots of grunt, even before mods.  I loved the power, sound, and capability of the car. The 6MT was superb, and track time was great. Interior and exterior were well appointed.  Having previously owned a G35S and thinking that the German cars were just too costly, I was very pleased to learn that the driving experience was much much better in the Bimmer. I was concerned with the cost of maintenance after warranty so I sold it to get a larger car for kids.  I will own another 3 series (sedan) at some point.  Costly.  Took a bath on the sale price.  ugh.", 10/07/14,4,6376
"Sport, yet refined"," Went from a Honda civic, so naturally am impressed with the handling of this well made auto. It has plenty of power, with excellent cornering and braking. Everyone in the family says it makes me look younger!", 09/04/09,5,1471
Smooth coupe, Small but sporty, 10/04/16,5,2401
2001 330i," Coolest car I have ever owned by a long shot.  This car is a rocket, but I can still get 31 mpg on the highway (if I drive the speed limit).  ", 07/01/08,5,5774
Great fun to drive," I really love this car.It handles is like a groove in the road.I do have a few complaints.First, the throttle response sucks (at least when new).Auto trans starts in 2nd and there seems to be a lag getting up to speed when driving normally.Punching it will start in 1st, but there is still a slight delay then up to speed quickly.Dealer said the trans will ""learn"" based on driving habits.Surprisingly, he seems to be right and it has gotten better or I have gotten used to it.The aux connection is in the center console but no place for the cord to exit.Stock stereo on my 1998 Maxima probably sounds better.Can't read stereo with polarized sun glasses.", 02/04/11,5,6392
great car, I love this car. Traded in a 2000 ford expedition and I do not miss it. This car has power and speed and just looks great. The only improvement BMW could do is get rid of the tape player with the navigation system. Who uses a tape player? We are in the age of MP3 players and BMW should take a serious look at improving to this technology. Also please update your whole audio system. Your upgrade Harmon audio system should be compatible to the navigation system. With these concerns I still do love to drive it. BMW is truly the ultimate driving machine., 02/06/06,5,1087
New Retirement Gift, Ordered and just received a new 2018 BMW X3 - couldn‚Äôt be happier.  Car is much more than I expected - all excellent.  Retirement started last week - now I get to ride in style - nothing beats a BMW !, 04/15/18,5,2887
brand new 15 year old Z4," Probably too soon to rate it since I have had it for only a week, but, the car with only 23k miles (verified) feels brand new. The sound is great, the punch is great.  The ride is not as harsh as I feared. It's certainly not '55 Buick either. It's a little tight, but much more comfortable than Miata that I didn't buy because of the fit. When I had it inspected the guy in the station said, ""thanks for bringing that car to us."" First time that's ever happened.  We'll see how long honeymoon lasts.", 04/19/18,5,7578
Great car but different from past BMWs," Got a 2012 528 M Sport, traded in my 2002 540i 200k miles later.The 540 was a 4 door sports car and I loved it.Negatives first - this one is a luxury car that tightens up in sport mode to be a great grand touring vehicle, but its not a sports car.Which is fine with me because it is my daily driver.Positives - WAY more comfortable and quiet, spectacular fuel economy (getting 34mpg hwy and 27.5 average).Love the interior (switches all in the same place as my E39) + large NAV screen. The turbo 4 takes a little getting used to coming from a V8 but it really goes if you push the pedal far enough.", 06/11/13,5,3435
Poor handling," Has anyone experienced this issue and was there a resolution to this SUV's poor handling stability?I used to own a 2008 X3 which had the traditional great performing stiff hydraulic power steering, now this X3 comes with some kind of ""electric"" assist on steering which may or may not be the cause for an unstable ride when driving on uneven pavement (especially wheel gutters from nordic states spring thaw).The car is simply unstable in its direction, it feels like you constantly need to fight the direction with oposition move on steering wheel to prevent it from swaying to right or left.Does this sound familiar to anyone?Please help, this car is great otherwise.", 05/15/13,4,2835
Do not invest into BMW!," DO NOT INVEST INTO BMW!!!This company does NOT stand by their word nor treat the customer with respect. If you have a warranty they will not stand by it. All they want is your money... Heads up!When you purchase a car that is considered a lemon how many times does somebody have to bring the car in with the same issues? Especially within the week & first year of buying a vehicle? The 1st week after i bought The car it broke down! With loud and shaky idles, transmission issues, steering issues, bmw has seen the repair history. I'm honestly afraid of what the future holds for this car. I feel my families safety is in jeopardy & this is documentation if anything happens. Is this something that usually happens & is this a good experience for a BMW owner?I've brought this car in numerous times within the first year, one of them being within the first week that I bought it. Did BMW even do the proper screening for this CPO?Doing my research there are numerous recalls on this car and I feel that the issues directly relate with the problems with this car. I wanted give bmw every opportunity to make this right and since you're not doing so and just are offering only me one payment which doesn't help anything with the lemon you guys sold me. I will be sharing my story from many different avenues and not recommending BMW. I'm extremely disappointed and very discouraged!", 12/25/15,1,6441
BMW Z4, First sports car owned in 30 years.  Put the fun back in driving. Handles and corners well.  Good acceleration off the line.  Mine is a 2.5 model and I never drove the 3.0 model but I think it would benefit from the extra power.  No downsides on the car.  Interior better in this than Boxster (until 2005 model).  Fast enough for my kind of driving (64 years old).  Glad I bought it., 02/11/05,5,7721
I'm In Love," We just bought this BMW, which is our first jump from Volvo into any other vehicle in over 15 years.  We were blown away by the performance of the engine, the luxury of the interior and how an SUV (don't care if BMW calls it an SAV or not, it's still an SUV) actually handles like a car.  God willing, we're going to remain BMW owners for a long time.  We bought an extended warranty at the dealer, as we've read here at Edmunds that repairs can become an issue.  If you find a good used one like we did our pristine ""new"" x5, buy it. I'm blown away each time I get in the car at how well it's made.  Even down to the alarm key.  We loved BMW so much, we ran out and bought a 740i for the husband the next weekend.", 05/13/08,5,976
Love That BMW!," The BMW 330Ci is an outstanding car.Great looking and comfortable, itrovides amazing performance in every ctegory.  The brakes let you ""stop on ime"" without a fuss.  The acleration is really exciting ando'l have passengers asking you to so own before you even reach youreie speed.  The cornering is beyond wa o thought possible.  Fouri-otpeople find comfort in its spl ether seats while the trunkrvdsalot of space.  When the top i p o'e in a very comforting andue al. And, even though it is a cnetbe he ride is as solid and omniga ou'd expect in any high-performance BMW.  ", 05/31/04,5,4755
THe best got better," Traded in our beloved 2004 325i wagon, the wife actually cried when we gave it to the dealer, for the 2007 328i which we knew couldn't be as good as our 2004 model. WE WERE WRONG! The '07 is more refined, better handling, faster, and smoother than our old wagon. Only area of concern to me is run flat tires, I much prefer a spare, but have had no issues at all.", 01/14/08,5,4635
Driver Heaven," This is a most awesome machine, finelytuned, the penultimate BMW achievement. Comfortable interiorelies the power under the hood. Don't mke the mistake of pushingh ""sport"" button unless you're peared for the extraordinary surgenpwer and control ""freedom"" that ese. Don't get this vehicle (if youa id one) unless you don't mind cntn attention and admiring looksrmbsanders and other drivers.", 01/18/04,5,2329
The Ultimate Drivng Machine, This vehicle REALLY is the ultimate driving machine.  I've enjoyed driving it every time!  This car even makes going to the grocery store fun.  It's the little things I appreciate!! I can hardly wait for the seven passenger!, 07/06/06,5,1083
Nice SUV," I looked at and test drove MB-350, Q-56, Escalade and found the BMW to ride the best. I am a previous BMW owner (335I) but wanted a SUV this time. The ride is smooth and I had mine custom ordered. Only have had it for a month but so far I am very happy.", 09/09/08,5,863
3 Strikes you're out!!," I bought my 2009 335xi in August after driving my C70 Volvo into the ground with 173k on it. The volvo was a sled compared to this beauty. This car is not problem free! I have had the car in four times for warranty and I'm still not happy.  First check engine light "" miss fire "" second time bad high pressure fuel pump, third time, mechanical fuel pump.  Turn on the intermittent wiper and listen to the relay click under the dash. Dealer says that's normal.  Then the seat belt arm shorted out. So they replaced that. I just bought 4 Toyota Yaris for my delivery fleet and they are quieter than this BMW. Dealer said get use to the noises I said are you kidding me !!", 12/04/09,4,6246
BMW 7 Series The Ultimate Starship," This is BMW's flagship sedan and it does not disappoint in any way. Power, comfort, styling, safety and technology are all present here. One can easily go from 0-60 in less than 7 seconds, and at high speeds feel as if you are going half the pace with room to spare. More fun to drive than Mercedes, or Lexus combined!! The feel is rock solid and it handles like the 5 passenger sports car it really is. Plenty of creature comforts and cutting edge technology even in the older models. I have owned several hugh end luxury vehicles, domestic and foreign and this one is the best of all. It deserves the title ""Ultimate Driving Machine"" - I just can't see or imagine myself in any other car at all.!!", 02/14/08,5,2176
BMW's Colossal Blunder," Great car, fun to drive... but impractical!  The sports package  comes with run flat tires and a donut.  No room to put in full sized tire in the well.  But  I am better off than those with a 2006 or later 3 series who have no spare at all..  Get a flat wiith these babies and you can go 150 miles.  You can put on the donut and  go about the same distance.  Get a flat tire over the weekend like I did and you are out of pocket for 2 days. Nobody, I repeat nobody stocks the odd ball tires.  This is a MAJOR flaw in the BMW.  Hear that Edmunds?   BTW, the run flats are not repairable, so you are looking at over $300 a pop for a flat. Also they ride terribly and have 15,000 mile tread life.", 05/07/06,4,4026
Average, I have owned this car for a year and find it very average.The steering is terrible and the transmission gear selection is also terrible.The rest is borderline average.It demonstrates very little value for the money. Its much to heavy.Its far from the ultimate driving machine.Not much fun to drive., 06/30/11,3,4174
Tutonic toy," well handling this, car is planted! Go-cart response. Fun to drive, a joy on twisty roads. Top up or top down a real hoot.", 03/10/02,5,2984
Great Value as Used Car," For the last 20 years, I've bought used (2-3 yr old) luxury cars with great success. My ""new"" '03 BMW continues that string.  This particular car is a one-owner lease turn-in, BMW certified, fully loaded, 39,000 miles.  For $23 thou, it's a great value: fun to drive, looks better than the new 3-series, somebody else has worked out all the kinks, and I got the 100m BMW certified warranty.  Life is too short to drive a car with no soul!  This car just brings a smile to my face everytime I drive it.", 05/18/06,5,4945
Inherited Car," I'm not a ""car person"" so you guys bear with me.  I inherited this car from my husband.  We were married this year and this was his car he was left with after the divorce (wife got Toyota Land Cruiser and he got one for himself after awful experience with a Ford Explorer) The car has alot of miles on it, but according to others, not alot for a BMW. All maintenance is expensive!  Still needs a bit of work, but drives like a dream and looks great! I have thought of trading in for something new, but I've decided to keep it because it really is good quality.  If I could buy a brand new car and price was not an option, it would be another BMW.  ", 04/29/05,4,3653
OK with Reservations," We picked this car as a CPO from a BMW dealer.  No problems to date.  Relatively decent handling for the type car, and just the right size and height.  We stayed away from the newer version to avoid a Mini based front wheel platform derived car as opposed to a BMW based one.  The new 2018 X1 also features a flimsy cloth covering under the moonroof that I can see ripping quickly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         If you want a X1 like this may I suggest springing for the upgraded interior.  Base level seating has poor lateral support and are unacceptable.  Base halogen headlights are unacceptable and should be avoided.  My 3 series coupe has xenons which are ""light years"" better.  Sorry!:-)  Base sound system is ""media-ocre"" at best.  I don't understand the need for moonroofs on BMWs, and wish they would apportion the monies elsewhere and delete them.  Acceleration with the 240 hp is considerably better than you would expect for a 4 cyl.  It feels like a 6!  Braking is only adequate , but some experts blame this on the stock tires rather than the car.  I also would like a manual transmission X1 like they have in other countries!  When you're shopping, seek out a well optioned example only!  A base car sporting only a badge is bad form indeed.", 04/10/18,3,2
Long live the King," The M5 is definitely the pinnicle ofthe sports sedan market.  The E 55 doesn't come with a manualransmission, the S6 is too soft and lads up in the corners, and the XJR isut too heavy.  BMW has given these cr telepathic handling, perfectlyegted steering, and one of the best tasissions I have ever used.  Theefc, seamless blend of raw power, rc npired handling, BMW luxury.  the king!", 10/29/02,5,8013
"Good, but some build problems"," Overall, this has been the best car I'veowned.  My previous cars include a 2001Corvette Coupe and 1995 Ford Contour. Balance and handling are outstanding.Engine could use a little more power. (My  last car was a Corvette, however). I am a little dissapointed in the buildquality.  Specifically, the speaker inthe passenger side door rattles andbuzzes the door panel.  This is a commonproblem for the coupes over the yearsand BMW should have fixed this by now.", 03/26/04,5,4770
Pleasure and pain," I bought the car w/38k miles.  In the 22k I've put on it, it's given me lots of smiles, and also had me cursing at it.  It's a great performer and handler, but I've replaced a mass air sensor, camshaft sensor, CD changer and more.  I'm not sure if I would get another one.", 10/30/06,4,3904
DCT was not made for city traffic," Purchased this 135i in 2013. My first new BMW. I am a big time auto enthusiast and had to jump on the 135i before the electric steering came in. The 135i  has been pretty reliable but there are a few issues that are worth noting, such as dash and suspension squeaks. The car drinks gas, I avg about 13mpg on NYC roads. Also the DCT has a horrible lag on initial take off, I took it to the dealer for a software update and it helped but still not satisfactory to me. The only benefit I have seen with the DCT is the lightning quick shifts which is only great at high speeds. If you won't track the car often, I suggest the regular auto over the DCT. ", 02/02/15,3,1542
What a BEAST Machine," Drove 3-series all my life until I got this beast.  6 speed is out of this world. Acceleration, handling and cornering couldn't be finer.  I swapped out the run flats immediately even though there was only 19,000 on car.  What a difference without that extra weight.  Less expensive too.  First gear buries the tach a little too fast but you get use to the quick shift to second.  I took it to the limit 160+ once and it was still quiet in the rag top.  The iDrive is simple once you read the manual.  Quality and variations of the LOGIC7 is theater- like.  I'm 6'7"" and the cockpit is very accommodating.  I just love my BEAST for power and style.", 02/08/09,5,364
"Very Satisfied, but"," Overall, the performance, roadhandling,and drivability of this model BMW isoutstanding.  Also, the interior designand  comfort is all you could ask forfrom this size vehicle.  The onedisappointment is its poor road handlingon snowy roads.  My car came with 17""low profile all-season tires that trackvery poorly on snowy roads.  Snow tiresare a must in winter environments.Another negative impact of cold weatheron my  BMW's engine is about a 20%reduction in gas mileage.", 03/12/04,5,6011
325CI," This is my 5th 3 series bmw (2nd e46). The e46 has the best over fit, finish, quality, etc Overall it has everything. Its a tight ride, styling is excellent. I could go on and on. I tried a couple fords, gm's in between all the purchases of BMW, the BMW is just a well engineered car, no squeaks, etc", 03/10/02,5,5684
'99 BMW 328i Review," After owning a sport packaged 5 spd 328ifor more than three years now, I believe I can offer an experienced rating ofhis vehicle. Having spent 39K and cange not including taxes on a seriesht started out at 27K I had high (and jsified) expectations. All were met. Apr packaged 328i 5 spd delivers all teprformance, fun, and practicalitynoecould want from a ""sedan"". The crloed good, had no build qualitysus nd only three minor recalls ta eehandled quickly. I'm nowatn o an M3 that I've just odrd n I know I will enjoy the newa eymc, but even this new coupe wl o rvde the user friendly broad ag fqaiies that the 328", 04/26/02,5,5517
Just what the dorctor ordered....," Having trst driven everything in thisclass that Mercedes, Audi, Lexus and Jaguar had to offer, I returned to the40 with open arms. The 6-speed stick-shift just clinched it for me every tme. (The M5 had not yet beeneeased, and at $75K+...er...I don't tik so).", 12/03/02,5,3674
Orange Bimmer," I have owned many different cars from nearly every major manufacturer and this car is, by far, the most fun to drive.It is almost as exciting to drive as the Gallardo I drove in Vegas, and this car I can actually own (and do).It is in it's break-in period, but it is still a blast to drive through back roads.Averaging about 20/21 mpg currently.", 11/28/11,5,1368
BMW, Great looks. Power is decent. The only issues I have are the tire wear (sport package) and way too many rattles in the interior. Prefer standard dash contols over the iDrive., 12/01/05,4,3511
happy, thw best car in the world cant be , 09/20/03,5,1725
excellent buy, If you have the money... this is the , 03/19/04,5,4772
OK Car but you can get a better car for that money," We bought the vehicle on june of 2015, we owned 3 previous MB GLK's (totaled 2) and a C240. We had great expectations about this car since supposedly is the Ultimate Driving machine. Steering wheel is extremely stiff, I know that's how german cars are but this was beyond any other VW or MB I have driving before. Brakes are great, and acceleration, oh man, pfffew, IT GOES!!!!!!! It is super fast. Fuel economy is OK for a 3.0 engine. X Drive works good in the snow but it's height does not compensate the 4x4. The bad, YOU WILL HAVE A MISFIRE! For sure, ignition coil will go bad any time after 50.000 miles, for some reason most of them burn oil even with low mileage. That is what I have been told. BMW dealer maintenance is really expensive. HID bulbs cost about $300 in the dealership plus $100 labor. I know crazy! Oil change about $300. The interioR quality is HORRIBLE, It just feels cheap. The plastics, even the wood trim.As of 2/16 we ended up getting another MB GLK 350. And now we have the car for sale. Overall, OK car. Better than any Jap car, not as good as other european.", 02/23/16,3,6076
The best new car experience ever, Drives like a charm. Still somewhat of an eye catcher :-) Gas mileage just below that of my retired 328i., 09/30/05,5,1779
Great looking car with performance that matches," I bought this car three years ago and I've generally been quite satisfied. It gets decent mileage overall and over 30mpg on the road. New passengers not aware of the brand will often ask what kind of car it is because it's so comfortable. Since the car has had very little wear its frequently confused with a newer car since the basic body design remained the same until 2010.It does have some flaws. One of these is that the I-Drive computer occasionally doesn't boot at start up and leaves me without a radio until it does. The parking radar often takes a while to shut off after leaving a parking space. However in the basics like comfort and performance the car is great. I did purchase an extended drive train warranty, but I've recently had a large number of systems fail in short order including the water pump, purge valve, and transmission pan and filter. There's also the standard German oil leak which is so minuscule that I've chosen not to fix it. My mechanic and I both think that this bad period will pass and that the car will remain reliable so I'm currently still positive about it. It's a great machine.Addendum: On the positive side I've just been in an accident where I was broadsided by  a driver who didn't try to stop. He must have  been doing at least 65 in a 45 speed limit zone. The car lost a fender and deployed the side but not front airbags. I lost one fender and little else. I walked away without a scratch. Very impressive! The only negative about this car and other BMWs is that some systems are unique so it's hard to find a mechanic who will work on one other than the dealer. Nevertheless, performance and now safety  are excellent.", 08/19/15,4,3967
A PERFECT 10," There is nothing bad about this vehicle, when I bought it, it was great and it hasn't declined in comfort or performance ever since. Buy this vehicle it is a keeper. I would pay up to a million dollars for it. I have a McLaren F1, and this machine is just as nice if not better. A perfect 10.", 02/19/05,5,393
Not reliable at all," The car is fun to drive, but at $73,000, I wouldn¬ít expect this many problems.  The front suspension has been replaced, twice, the trannie was replaced, the dash stopped working, the fan blades EXPLODED and cut the radiator lines and punctured the hood.  The drivers seat has stopped working 3 times, the nav system display broke, the engine leaks oil, and the car has less than 50,000 miles on it. Not worth the price paid at any cost.", 12/08/04,3,2032
It's worth it," Wow - what fun to drive.  I wish I had the extra power of the 550 or the 535, but this car has it when you need it.  I like to drive it in Drive Sport as it really hugs the road, and gives me the extra boost of speed.  ", 07/28/09,5,3200
Love the quiet," It's been a great first month. The car has had no issues.  Acceleration is amazing and the quiet is just sublime.  Good sound insulation also protects the interior from external noise as well as the lack of engine noise.  We've had no problems; range is as advertised.  Installed a 220 v 40 amp charger in the garage that is very convenient.  Haven't had to use the Range extender yet, though my wife told me she got a notification that the engine was cycling, presumably just to keep the fluids from settling too much.  Enormous headroom; I'm 6'4 and have another 2"" beyond the top of my head.  Visibility is excellent.  The rear seats are quite usable but wouldn't buy it if we anticipated using them a lot.  Lots of trunk space.  Only gripe is that the BMW technology integration is a bit wonky and takes some getting used to.  Would have loved to have electric seats, but I suspect that would have added significant weight.  Carbon fiber body is really nice as is the interior wood.  Seats are very comfortable.", 12/19/16,5,6774
Dr. Jeckyl/Mr. Hyde," This is our 3rd X3, and I loved the other two, both 2005s. This seems to be a different vehicle.  Same great finish and handling, but awful acceleration. As written elsewhere, it is bothersome and dangerous.  I loved the responsive, fun to drive qualities of our other X3s.  This one makes me scared to enter the highway. Not so fun.  Once you get past 40, it is fine, but getting there can be tough.  Sometimes you punch it and boom, other times you count to three before anything happens.  Someone is going to get into an accident because of this.  We went to the dealer and they tried a software fix, but it only made it marginally better and we seem to have lost 1-2 MPG. Disappointing.", 07/26/08,4,2512
'04 BMW 330 Performance Package," I'm 6'1"" 220. A little small and under powered for me. Matters not, it's the wife's car, never was about me. She loves everything about it. No getting rid of her baby. Things that are important to me. No problems mechanically, not even waranty issues. Never had to bring the car in. 12000 miles before oil change as per onboard computer. Tires wearing well, that's a good thing because they're */- $300.00 each.(Z rated tires). I find it fun to drive on short trips but highway driving, well, give me my suburban or a 540i any day. ", 10/06/05,5,4689
And they call it a truck," I love my 03 X5.  I take care of it like a baby and it takes care of me.  I don't run up the mileage and relatively speaking it has.t cost too much to maintain.  When something begins to go wrong I fix it and this minimizes major repair costs.  I had a 4 year warranty and extended it 2 more years.  The first 4 year warranty was great but the second 2 year warranty not so good.  3 items I am disappointed with would be the stereo (although it is better than my premium Honda sound), the digital reading on the dash board are beginning to go away and when I roll down the back window(s) and drive over 30 mph, the sound is deafening.  Otherwise my BMW X5 runs like a top.", 09/13/10,4,648
Still Happy with it after a month of driving," I got my 2011 BMW528i about a month ago and wanted to drive it a while before commenting on it.I purchased it as a replacement to my 1998 BMW528i that I had for 13 years!Now for the review:The interior is luxurious!The iDrive is new for me but after a few weeks of getting used to it, I like it.Why no touch screen though?The stereo is nice but could be a little better.The front seats seem cramped to me, maybe narrow the center console a bit?The automatic transmission seems sluggish until you shift into sport mode.The exterior is flawless.I haven't noticed any problems with the run flat tires but have been warned by many people to expect it.", 01/05/11,5,4190
My Dream Car," I've always wanted a BMW Z roadster ever since I test drove a Z3 in San Diego.At the time, I had just started working full time.I have always been an Engineer, but at the time I had a mountain of debt.When I finally had the means to purchase my dream car, Chris Bangle (Germany's answer to Sir Mix-a-Lot) violated the Z3's successor, the first generation Z4.So, I had to wait 7 long years for that abomination to leave the stage.The E89 Z4 was worth the wait.Strangers and acquaintences alike come up to me all the time to tell me that I have a beautiful car. I don't need a car that costs any more money, has any more performance, or looks any better (if possible).", 03/01/13,5,7825
Finally got my M3," I sold my 2006 G35 6mt coupe and got an 02 M3. Wow, night and day as far as performance! Yea, the deck rattles from the bass and the front tweeters seem to be blown and the pass side window trim was sagging. But its a $55000 plus car I stole for $15000 and other than the few inexpensive problems its my favorite car ever! So fast, smells german inside, the paint is amazing, the looks, the sounds, the power and yes, even the gas mileage is out of this world. I hope it stays this great! I put 89000 on my G and never one time in the shop. That I will miss and hope my new bemmer does just as well. Dont buy a ragged out one, if they took care of it, it will take care of you. M3 for Life!!!", 02/04/10,5,7220
"Wonderful sound, great handling coupe"," First, do European delivery. This car was meant to take to the 'ring, drive on the autobahn and tour the Bavarian Alps. A true Jekyll and Hyde car. 6 speed man., 220m wheels, tech pack. Did not get the zcp comp. Pack. Amazing sounds and performance at higher rpms. Not a torque monster (it's normally aspirated after all) but the rush you get over 4,500 rpm is just amazing. Keep rpm down and it drives nicely and, considering it's a v8, does okay mileage-wise on the highway. Dial edc to comfort and it's a nice sporty ride. Go to sport, push the car, and it shows its other side. Carves like a knife. Incredibly composed either way. ", 08/10/10,5,7386
Awesome drive," I don't understand what the fuss is about this car.  The iDrive, while it has its quirks, it's great after you learn to use it, after all this is the computer age.  But regardless it is the best driving car on the road unless you want a really bumpy and loud sports car, this car has the performance and handling of a sports car that is actually comfortable to drive.  There might be prettier luxury cars out there but none drive like this one.", 06/16/06,5,2092

Love this vehicle," Shop around. Visit a couple of dealerships first to get your best price. Packages can increase the cost quickly. Lighting package a must: headlights are phenomenal; Technology and Premium package a must. You do not need the rear camera or the blind spot package (unless you have small children at home)because the x3 has very good visibility on it's own. Very, very comfortable on long road trips. Love this vehicle. Very pleased, and fun to drive. The only thing: I wish it had a 5 star crash rating for the front passenger - it has a 4. This is my second bimmer. (My prior BMW was a 328iXdrive sedan with the M Sport package. Loved this one as well. I almost cried when handing it in at the end of the lease!.) A YEAR LATER: STILL LOVE THIS VEHICLE!", 03/28/16,5,2622
My favorite car by my favorite manufacturer...BMW!," This car makes car number 7 for me. I have loved BMW cars for as long as I can remember and my all-time favorite car...period...is the BMW X5 since its market debut.  But this BMW....my baby...my boopie doopie...my Nu-Nu...which is her name...is THE BEST CAR I have yet to own.  I purchased this car in December 2014....because I needed a car...and of course it was a BMW.  I use to sell cars, so needless to say I got her for a great deal. And what a total blessing she has been to me. I knew she needed a new convertible top....no biggie!  And her top coat is peeling a lil...no biggie!  But how does she run is what I NEEDED  to know!  And let me just say....Amazing! From day one...it was love at first sight...then true love at first drive. Buy one...if you see it...grab it!!!  Seriously!  And she had 169k miles on her...and we are now going on 175k....and all I've needed...thus far (knocking on wood!) was an oil change...windshield wipers...and a tire due to a nail!  I do take her to the BMW dealer....the best service too by the way...Otto's BMW in West Chester, PA....I love those folks. When she leaves there after an oil change....all clean and smelling good....she purrrrrrsss!  As if to say....Thank You!!!  I only put premium gas in her....Shell V-Tech w/Nitro....also the best...in my car...nothing is too good!  IJS  And this is just for say.... This car is my first import, black car, convertible, coupe, rear-wheel drive, and sports car....but my BEST car first and for most. And that's how she got her name... NuNu...cause she is very Nu to me is so many different ways as an owner.  Thanks for reading...and pay attention to the reviews on this car....cause they are true to life! #BMWGIRL #BMW4LIFE #ULTIMATEDRIVINGMACHINE", 08/30/15,5,6506
M5 Rocks, Need I say more?, 04/11/02,5,7947
Just plain fun," A great looking car. It's a blast to drive.  Unlimited acceleration.  Almost feels like a go cart.  Love the ability to unlock the car and start it w/o taking keys out of my pocket. Seats not great for the bigger body as they are heavily bolstered. Don't buy this car if you drive almost exclusively in heavy traffic.  When you can't enjoy its potential, it's just another car.", 11/12/07,5,4563
Becoming harder to love," Fully loaded, w/manual trans. Very fun to drive, nice features, looks great. My main complaint I have is about the tires. Had to replace all 4 tires within a year because of bubbles on the sidewall. At $400+ a pop, this is very expensive. Plus, the summer run flat tires are no good in the winter (they don't make all season run flats yet as I soon learned). Also had a couple of cracked rims, which was easily fixed, but still very annoying. I swapped for regular all season tires and bought a spare tire kit. The car handles so much better and is even smoother. However, wasn't able to avoid another cracked rim :/ if you don't live in a town with well paved roads, beware of this vehicle!", 08/04/10,4,4541
Complete Luxury," This is my 4th BMW. Too bad my other 3 were all M series so that is all I have to compare this car to. However, the performance of this car is pretty amazing despite the fact that the steering is not tight enough for me.  None the less, the luxury of this car is unmatched by anything I have ever driven. ", 04/15/08,5,5393
"Beautiful Car Inside & Out, Unique, Comfy"," This is by far the best car I've ever had. For me, it is the kind of car that will make me glad I have to drive somewhere. The Sports seat comfort with thigh-support pull-out is excellent, as are the adjustable bolsters. I have a bad back with L5-S1 herniation history, yet don't have the leather, or lumbar supports, but don't need  or want them! I switched over from Buick, primarily because of seat support and comfort. The firm ride handles everything quite nimbly, for such a heavy absorbent BMW feel. I got the Sport Line trim package, with the optional M-Sport steering wheel, overall a very nice appearance. I get a lot of stares and questions on it; the Silver metallic with Sports Line trim (+ tinted windows and an added rear hatch window spoiler). There is a bit of delay in acceleration on occasion, its almost like you have to time it to get it right; despite the twin-scroll turbo which improves things, but once it goes (you MUST use Sports+ Mode to actually feel it), it rocks! The grandkids always beg me ""Opa, put it in Sport Mode!"". Braking is solid. There is a tad bit of sway for significant cornering, expected but not bad for a heavier car (I was told that this is actually a 5-series platform/chassis, but I haven't been able to confirm that; if you are cross-shopping w/the 4 series Gran Coupe/GC, one dealer actually said the 3GT is actually a 5-series, and the 4GC is actually a 3-series!).  There is a bit of engine noise during hard acceleration, but it is not bad. There is a bit of sunroof wind noise, probably my primary complaint overall as the ride experience goes (made much worse by the base rack which I now only use when transporting bikes/kayaks), but yet I am still able to chair tele-conferences with no problems while speaking or hearing on other end via Bluetooth, which is consistent and without problems despite previous reviewers comments. Road noise is minimal, enough to know your in a motor vehicle, but kept to a minimum. I love the back liftgate, as it is easier to load and unload than a typical trunk. It is by intent a coupe design, meaning a lowered-in cockpit feel, so getting in and out is not as easier as you might think for a car that sits higher than a traditional 3-series sedan. The infotainment system works great; you can look at the large monitor screen while scrolling and tapping, without even looking at the iDrive you are manipulating with your right hand...and the base stereo which is Harmon-Kardon is actually pretty good, but I am going to upgrade the front dash & door speakers because I am an audiophile. I agree with a friend who used to work in an upscale audio center that the low end preforms very well (as there are 2 subwoofers, located underneath the front seats), the midrange and high end/tweeter are fine/good but not great. The Nav works very well and is worth it. The internal HD for music storage is a great feature, but I HATE how it only plays back the songs on a CD that you recorded in alphabetical order --- word to BMW: album rock and live music CDs are meant to be played in the track order recorded, stop being so organized you Germans!:). Playing off a thumbdrive is also very easy, and the steering wheel mounted controls help, although I believe in terms of human ergonomics, that the volume and media controls should be on the Left side of the steering wheel, NOT the Right [if you look at the actual dash stereo controls and the steering wheel stereo controls, they are literally only about 6 inches apart from each other, so the point of saving a reach or having multiple ways to do the same thing is minimized; why not place those stereo controls on the Left, now you can control the stereo functions with either your Left or your Right hand?]!I have averaged in the high 20s for MPG in mixed driving; I do not gun it a lot, but I certainly drive it in a more spirited manner a couple times a week! I have averaged 36-38 MPG on long trips in ECO mode, one trick to doing this well (I once got 39 MPG on a long trip!) is increasing the tire pressures to 33 PSI-front & 36 PSI-back (32 & 35 recommended, but there is always an acceptable range).  Check & adjust your PSI twice a month, so many people don't do this and it is extremely important, especially the way the vehicle dynamics in this vehicle work, and the fact that front & rear are 3 PSI difference! The handling, agility, and MPG are significantly affected by PSI.", 12/01/15,4,168
"Fun to drive, but..."," Feels as solid as a tank.  Could be quicker but fun nonetheless.  Handles as if on rails.  The controls are in all of the right places.  Looks to kill.  Perfect car, but it's an absolute money pit to own.  Spent $6000 on repair bills including water pump, computer ($2000), rear-end bushings, 3 window actuators ($375/each) and other misc. parts.  Dealer wanted to do even more repairs totaling $4000 (replacing radiator and expansion tank was $2500!).  Walk away uless it comes with a very good extended warranty. ", 03/31/07,4,5467
Still very pleased," Purchased a 2 year old 535d that is pristine.  After a few weeks I have few complaints, the iDrive controller being the main source of frustration.  That aside, drives very well, great road car, good seats and more bells and whistles than anyone needs.  Once again, buying a truly well maintained used car is the way to go.  Let somebody else take that huge depreciation hit.  :)Seven month update:  Still enjoy driving this car very much.  The diesel engine is a different driving experience.  No need to wind the rpms; the torque is all in the lower ranges and the automatic  tranny is well programmed to work with the unique torque curve.  75 mph gets you 40 mpg and my around town/area driving pattern yields a 30 mpg average.  Terrific road car with plenty of passing acceleration.  Still have not figured out everything about the iDrive, but there are physical buttons for many functions, much better than aiming at a touch screen and hoping for the best.  I'd buy this car again in a heartbeat.", 08/27/17,5,3463
Excellent Car.," Looking at the IS300, C Class, X-Type, etc., the 3 Series is by far the best.  Most comfortable, most mible, most fun.", 03/10/02,5,5740
Did I buy a lemon? Tastes bitter!, Bought X5 a year ago tomorrow and will be taking to dealership again.  This time a repeat 4x4 and DSC warning. Last time fault blamed on us leaving a battery powered XM radio plugged into the receptacle inside the armrest storage that caused the battery level to drop?! Today same problem while driving on the highway. Can't wait to hear next excuse. Have taken car in at least 5 times for loud noise when taking out of park. In December Parking Brake would not disengage while 700 miles from home. BMW Assist could not tell us how to manually disengage brake but wanted to drag it onto a flatbed. Dealer told us how. Start-Off Assist jerks back on flat ground!! This is normal? Otherwise great car., 03/27/09,3,849
The greatest toy I own," I'm only writing a review after reading so many people either complaining about the size of the back seat, how low the car is, or about an option that they chose to go with.  It's a high performance coupe, expect it to be low and have small back seats.  You knew this when test driving it and it was YOUR choice!  It's not the cars fault you didn't pay attention.That being said, the 2009 135i 6 speed manual is an absolute beast.  Not to mention they are quite rare on the east coast so people notice a nice one.  I'm a male in my late 20's and I've had this car for 4 years.  This car is a rocket and handles like nothing I've ever driven.  The 2009 comes with the twin turbo N54 engine which is the best part.  It's practically the same engine that is in the new 2015 M3!  Just putting a chip in the car increases horsepower by 80-100HP to the wheels!  When I bring this car to the track, I leave M class BMW's in the dust.  After a few modifications this is actually the fastest car I have ever been in.Power aside, the trunk is quite large and the back seats fold down.  I fit a brand new 55 inch TV (still in the box) into this car.  I've also fit 4 brand new 18 inch rims/tires!  You'd be surprised on how much this car can fit!  I also have my friends in the back seats all the time with no complaints.  The issue is that the driver and passenger tend to have their seats further back than needed and don't realize it!I can honestly say that this car is the greatest thing I have ever purchased.  If you are in a similar situation as me, don't have kids, and like a beautiful interior/exterior with insane power.  Look no further.  One quick note:Run flat tires come standard on this car and it makes the car drive stiffer due to the sidewalls of the tires being harder.  If you replace them with regular tires (which are way cheaper in price) you'll find it drives much differently.  I prefer the regular tires and I'm willing to accept the risk.  Keep in mind that this car does not have a spare tire!", 07/28/15,5,1457
The Ultimate Driving Machine," I purchased the car used with about 30K miles on it. I have been driving it for about a year and absolutely love it. I drove some used Audis and Mercedes and they just didn't have the sporty/luxury feel I was looking for in a car. The engine is quick to respond when you step on it, and there is just enough room in the car for my 6'7'' frame, with enough to fit my average sized friends in the back. I test drove the 525i and there wasn't enough power. Loved the 540i, but didn't want the gas mileage problem. Couldn't ask for a better car, love it and I never see myself going away from BMWs. ", 04/21/06,5,3737
Looking for another brand next time," Many small things have gone wrong orbroken in the vehicle, which meant many trips to the dealer to have themepaired.

Good - Not Perfect," If you're a 'driver' you'll love the steering, suspension and handling. Plus, the car is tight, engine is smooth and interior is perfect. But... HD radio is terrible. Constantly flips in & out of HD, save your money. BMW won't fix it. Auto trans is also sketchy. In sport mode it won't ever go to 6th gear and regular mode just doesn't downshift readily. If you're doing 40 MPH and step on it, it bogs down unless you press deep on the pedal. It makes the car feel underpowered. But you can punch it down a gear (or 2) with paddle shifters (I have sport pkg). Had a 330i with 5-spd prior to this and power wise, this is a little disappointing. If you're on the fence... get the Turbo! Wish I did.", 10/17/09,5,6249

Very Pleased," I've owned the new 4.8 V-8 x5 since February. It has a great ride & with the ""Sport"" option it really gets up and goes. It is very fast for the size of the vehicle. It handles really well & corners without any over steer. Great ride & the engine is silky smooth. I put on most of the options & can't figure out why so many people complain about the iDrive. If you use a computer you can use the iDrive. I don't have to look & it is easy to navigate. There are a lot of options to set to your liking with the iDrive & I think that may be why people complain. Great vehicle. I'll buy a new one every 4 years or so. One last note that there isn't any maintenance dollars out of my pocket. ", 10/08/08,5,861
Best car I've ever bought.," I've read professional reviews that say this car is extremely ugly and I have to disagree.It's exterior design looks both class and sporty at the same time.Back seat leg space was important as I have four college age children.This has as much room as the 7 series.I needed cargo space as I transport kids to/from their schools with all their dorm needs.There is plenty of room for all their stuff.In addition, I am disabled and love how easy it is to close the hatch and pull down the back seats for additional cargo space.I had a 2007 525i with an inline six-cylinder engine.I now have the four cylinder and it has more power than my 525i, making is amazingly fun to drive.", 05/21/14,5,148
I pay with a smile," I enjoy this car so much.  I actually enjoy sending in my loan payment.  It has the best of so many things that make it luxurious and fun to drive.

I can't imagine driving any make other than BMW.    ", 03/25/05,5,5476
NOT PERFECT BUT GOOD," Build quality and driving experience are top notch. Here are my issues; (i) because it handles so well, it is not that great in the snow; (ii) it is vault tight but there quite a few rattles in the back which started after 5000 miles; (iii) there could have been a bigger cargo area-my corvette has almost as much room; (iv) very sensitive check engine light warning system and not all deales know how to fix it-one dealer said my car need a full day of re-programming... a second simply reset itminutes after I arrived for service. Do not open gas cap while engine is running.", 02/16/11,4,1229

Estoril blue beauty," In my honeymoon phase.  Drove out of state to PA to pick up this totally loaded 2016 435i X drive.  I test drove the 4 cylinder. Trading in my 335,  I wasn't happy driving the 4. It was sluggish and heavy. Not with the v6.   Highly recommend the M Sport package.  This car was loaded ( MSport, Nav, surround cameras, entertainment, etc) with everything I would have ordered,  except the price and financing couldn't be matched by waiting on a 2017.  It truly is the best of both worlds. Top up zero noise. Top down, wow! :-).  If you can still find a 2016, equipped the way you want, then buy it. The warranty is longer, too. BMW moved to 3 years for 2017.", 09/18/16,5,2424
2004 330Cic ZHP," Awesome, Awesome, Awesome is the bestway to describe this car.  I recently purchased mine 6-speed with theerformance Package (M Kit) in Dark Gay with Black interior.  I have noten another one like it on the road (ny 5 in California when purchased).", 07/20/04,5,4810
It really is a value.," When you consider what this car hasand does, plus the sheer good looks and safety, it's more than worth theash.  I've experienced no problems at al, and the dealership is amazing.   back in the BMW camp for good thistie", 04/21/02,5,6035
Long Term Ownership review - 4 + years," I bought this car with 18,000 miles on it in August 2013. It currently has 107,000 on it in January 2018.  The acceleration is really good! Cost of ownership is terrible, still owe $9,000 on the principal loan and it's starting to fall apart. Things that broke: 4 ignition coils (2 separate occasions), costing me about $25 / coil per time (DIY repair), 2 complete sets of tires. Currently the car has these problems: 2 bad rear wheel bearings, a failed DISA valve (engine rattle on acceleration) , serpentine belt tensioner pulley is slightly squeaking, rear upper control arm bushing is worn, and oil pan gasket and valve cover gaskets are leaking. The DISA valve is a known issue and a problem solver repair kit exists on Ebay for $80 (a new DISA valve costs about $250, and it will break down like the original). I'll be replacing the valve and wheel bearings as soon as the cold weather breaks. I love the way the car looks and handles so I'll be keeping it after it's paid off.", 02/02/18,4,6354
Kid and family friendly!," I liked the 3 sedan but wanted something with more room in the back so looked at the 5 series, TLX, Lexus GS, ES (back seat was huge but drive was disconnected) . 3 series GT was a last minute thing and the moment we looked at it we knew we were getting it.  If you have family that will ride in the second row regularly or have baby seats you should definitely look at the GT before you look at anything bigger or smaller. Has higher ride and higher center of gravity so will not be the same feel as a 3 sedan, but not as bad as an SUV and better than many other low riding cars. Compared to what the kids in the second row get, it was not a lot in driving fun that I had to give up.", 03/29/15,5,171
